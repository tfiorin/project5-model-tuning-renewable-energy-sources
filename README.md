# project5-model-tuning-renewable-energy-sources

## AI & Machine Learning Series: Model Tuning - Renewable Energy Sources

This project is part of the **AI & Machine Learning Series**, focusing on **Model Tuning** techniques applied to the **Renewable Energy Sources** project, The AI Recommendation System leverages Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Machine Learning (ML), and AI to analyze customer data stored in the Customer Data Engine (CDE). The system generates personalized recommendations, enhancing user experience across the mobile app and website.
